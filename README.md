# scrapper-test

The purpose of this repository is only to practice for now it already has a command to scrapper to run it you just have to execute

`php artisan make: scrapper`

that command gets 10 items from a store and saves them in a database for now

to get those results you can use the `mydomain.com / graphiql` and you can play with graphql

thank you, any feedback is welcome
